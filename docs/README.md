AnonKlub focuses on building applications that allow for secure and anonymous proof of membership.
It does so by performing both ECDSA signatures and Merkle Tree inclusion verifications in a SNARK.
It enables privacy applications such as anonymous airdrops, anonymous NFT minting, anonymous chat groupsâ€¦
